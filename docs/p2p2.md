## P2p v2.0 design

- Node and account ids are their public keys - grealy simplify design and tests
- Keys system is secp256k1 as it includes encrypt/decrypt (unlike ed25519 which only supports sigs)
- We use base58 encoding for string rep of keys (human readable)
- In proto messages keys/ids can be []bytes - no need for encoding as we are using a binary p2p format.

## unrulyp2p - our p2p protocol

### Transport
- tcp now, utp later

### Wire message format
<64 bits data size - big endian><message binary data (protobufs)>

- We use length prefixed protobufs messages as protobufs data doesn't include length to allow multiple messages on the same connection.

### Core P2P Server
- Responsible for establishing sessions with neighbors on startup (connecting to peers and getting neighbors)
- Gets wire-format messages from the transport and decodes them to a protobuf message
- Maintains connections with other peers (for reuse)
- Maintain session info for sessions with other peers. Session data includes an empheral session key used for encrypting / decrypting p2p messages.
- Handles sessions disconnections and can create a session with a peer
- Encapsulate session
- Supports gossip protocol - sends a message to all neighbors

### Handshake protocol (session protocol)
- Encrypted protobufs binary data with the destination public key (id)
- Used to establish empheral session key between peers
- Used by the core p2p server to establish sessions with remote nodes

### Higher-level protocols
- Message is encrypted with session key
- Ony non-encrypted part as the session id (server knows which remote node is part of session)
- Message content is protobufs
- Message content include message author authenticated data (may be diff than sender)
- Protocol handlders register callbacks with the core server
- Server calls the handler based on protocol / method message data.

### Basic flows
- An app-level p2p protocol wants to send a message to a node and process response.
- Protocol sends message to the core server
- The core server sends the message if it has a session with the remote peer or tries to establishe a new session with a peer. 
- The response is called back on protocol impl callback.

- App-level protocol can query the server for a list of active sessions or neighbor peers 
- Appl-level protocol may send a gossip message to all neighbors using the core server


Wire format (marshaled message):

`<64-bits-buff-size><buff-sized-binary-message-protobufed>`

Unmarshaled message from wire format

```
message {
    sessionId: uuid             // if there's a session between the peers
    senderPubKey: []btyte       // for session establish protocol - message is encrypted with sender private key and reciever pub key
    payload: []byte <encrypted-binary-protobufs format> // encrypted payload
}
````
Note that message only includes encrypted data and basic public data.
payload is protocol-specific. e.g. session protocol or an app-level protocol.
for app-level protocol it includes message-author data (might be diff than reciever)

app-level protocol payload format:

```
payload {
    clientVersion
    sendTimestamp  // message sent time
    senderPubKey   // message sender pub key
    nonce          // used for mac
    mac            // auth that message data sent by claimed sender (sign of all params)
    gossip bool    // sender requests this message to be gossiped to neighbors
    data: []bytes  // message data []byte protobufs marshaled
}

data {
    clientVersion // author client version
    authorPubKey // message writter pub key
    timestamp    // authored time
    nonce        // for mac
    mac          // all data bin sign by author
    protocol []string // protocol and message
    reqId        // responses include req id
    /* protocol specific fields go here */
}
```

### Session protocol

#### Sender req 1

#### Rec resp 1
